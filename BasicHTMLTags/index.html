  <h3>Worst Christmas Song and Why</h3>
  <dl>
    <dt>Name</dt>
    <dd>Frosty The Snowman</dd>
    <dt>Description</dt>
    <dd>It is a slower paced song with no real emotion to it. There is a very simple 4 4 beat the entire time, and there is no substancial content in the lyrics.</dd>
    <dt>Pros</dt>
    <dd>The song is catchy because of the pacing and simple beat.</dd>
    <dd>It can easily get stuck in someone's head for weeks</dd>
    <dt>Cons</dt>
    <dd>It lack emotional depth and any real connections made to the song aren't from the song, but from the character the song is about.</dd>
    <dd>My little sibling made me listen to the song 200000000000 times as a kid so now it's just annoying.</dd>
